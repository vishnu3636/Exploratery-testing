What is Exploratory Testing?
Exploratory Testing is a type of software testing where Test cases are not created in advance but testers check system on the fly. They may note down ideas about what to test before test execution. The focus of exploratory testing is more on testing as a “thinking” activity.

Exploratory Testing is widely used in Agile models and is all about discovery, investigation, and learning. It emphasizes personal freedom and responsibility of the individual tester.

Why Exploratory Testing?
Under scripted testing, you design test cases first and later proceed with test execution. On the contrary, exploratory testing is a simultaneous process of test design and test execution all done at the same time.

Scripted Test Execution is usually a non-thinking activity where testers execute the test steps and compare the actual results with expected results. Such test execution activity can be automated does not require many cognitive skills.

Though the current trend in software testing is to push for automation, exploratory testing is a new way of thinking. Automation has its limits.

Differences between Scripted and Exploratory Testing
Scripted Testing	                        Exploratory Testing
Directed from requirements	                Directed from requirements and exploring during testing
Determination of test cases well in advance	Determination of test cases during testing
Confirmation of testing with the requirements	Investigation of system or application
Emphasizes prediction and decision making	Emphasizes adaptability and learning
Involves confirmed testing	                Involves Investigation
Is about Controlling tests	                Is about Improvement of test design
Like making a speech – you read from a draft	Like making a conversation – it’s spontaneous
The script is in control	                The tester’s mind is in control

Exploratory Testing Techniques
Is not random testing but it is ad-hoc testing with a purpose of find bugs
Is structured and rigorous
Is cognitively (thinking) structured as compared to the procedural structure of scripted testing. This structure comes from Charter, time boxing etc.
Is highly teachable and manageable
It is not a technique but it is an approach. What actions you perform next is governed by what you are doing currently

How to execute Exploratory Tests
Following is a step by step process on How to perform Exploratory Testing which is also called session based test management (SBTM Cycle):

Step 1) Create a Bug Taxonomy (classification)
Categorize common types of faults found in the past projects
Analyze the root cause analysis of the problems or faults
Find the risks and develop ideas to test the application.

Step 2) Test Charter
Test Charter should suggest
what to test
how it can be tested
What needs to be looked
Test ideas are the starting point of exploration testing
Test charter helps determine how the end user could use the system

Step 3) Time Box
This method includes a pair of testers working together not less than 90 minutes
There should not be any interrupted time in those 90 minutes session
Timebox can be extended or reduced by 45 minutes
This session encourages testers to react on the response from the system and prepare for the correct outcome

Step 4) Review Results
Evaluation of the defects
Learning from the testing
Analysis of coverage areas

Step 5) Debriefing
Compilation of the output results
Compare the results with the charter
Check whether any additional testing is needed

Best practice Exploratory Testing
During exploratory execution, the following needs to be done:

The mission of testing should be very clear
Keep notes on what needs to be tested, why it needs to be tested and the assessment of the product quality
Tracking of questions and issues raised during exploratory testing
Better to pair up the testers for effective testing
The more we test, more likely to execute right test cases for the required scenarios

It is very important to take a document and monitor the following

Test Coverage – Whether we have taken notes on the coverage of test cases and improve the quality of the software
Risks – Which risks need to be covered and which are all important ones?
Test Execution Log – Recordings on the test execution
Issues / Queries – Take notes on the question and issues on the system

Smarter exploratory testing finds more errors in less time.

Pros and Cons of Exploratory Testing
Advantages

This testing is useful when requirement documents are not available or partially available
It involves Investigation process which helps find more bugs than normal testing-
Uncover bugs which are normally ignored by other testing techniques
Helps to expand the imagination of testers by executing more and more test cases which finally improves productivity as well
This testing drill down to the smallest part of an application and covers all the requirements
This testing covers all the types of testing and it covers various scenarios and cases
Encourages creativity and intuition
Generation of new ideas during test execution

Disadvantages
This testing purely depends on the tester skills
Limited by domain knowledge of the tester
Not suitable for Long execution time

Challenges of Exploratory Testing:
There are many challenges of exploratory testing and those are explained below:

Learning to use the application or software system is a challenge
Replication of failure is difficult
Determining whether tools need to be used can be challenging
Determine the best test cases to execute can be difficult
Reporting of the test results is a challenge as the report doesn’t have planned scripts or cases to compare with the actual result or outcome
Documentation of all events during execution is difficult to record
Don’t know when to stop the testing as exploratory testing has definite test cases to execute.

When use exploratory testing?
Exploratory testing can be used extensively when

The testing team has experienced testers
Early iteration is required
There is a critical application
New testers entered into the team

Conclusion:
In Software Engineering, Exploratory testing is performed to overcome the limitations of scripted testing. It helps in improving Test Case suite. It empathizes on learning and adaptability.
